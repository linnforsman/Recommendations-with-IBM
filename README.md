## Project Motivation
In this project, we'll analyze users' interactions with articles on the [IBM Watson Studio platform](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/login) and make recommendations to them about new articles they will like.

There are different approaches to the recommendation system, and 4 of them have been implemented in this project.
1. Rank Based Recommendation
2. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Content-Based Recommendation
4. Matrix Factorization
